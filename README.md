# 2D Arcade Space Shooter
Build our first 2D game in Unity, by making a 2D space fighter! Submitting on 2/14/2025.

The player will be able to fire a weapon, battle against enemy ships while dodging asteroids and gaining points. Each elimination provides points to the player. 
## Implementation
- The player can control the main ship, in the context of my game, this includes only left and right movement, but allows for looping through the side edges
- Can fire a weapon
- 1 enemy and 1 obstacle
- Scoring system included
# Extras from assignment suggestions
+ 1 for downloading and implementing assests for the player, enemies, asteroids, and both types of lasers
+ 1 for adding background images and stars
+ 1 for music on all play screens and menus
+ 1 for adding a sound effect when a laser is fired
# Personal Additions
- Implemented a lives system, where for 2 seconds after being hit, you are invulnerable (this took longer than I'd care to admit) you also are teleported back to the center of the screen
- Enemies and Asteroids are set to automatically spawn in at random intervals
- I felt that all the enemies shooting at the exact same time was unenjoyable, so they all fire at random times.
